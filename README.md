# Kotlin-Dagger-Rx2-Room-Database-Fresco-MVP
A simple MVP Android App developed in Kotlin

Basically is the same project as <a href="https://github.com/dbeqiraj/Kotlin-Dagger-Rx-Database-Fresco-MVP" target="_blank">this</a> one here. 

I decided to open a new project to keep things seperated since the first one is a copy of Filippo Engidashet's <a href="https://github.com/filippella/Dagger-Rx-Database-MVP" target="_blank">repo</a> in Kotlin.

This project is focused in how to integrate <strong>Room Database</strong> (instead of SQLite) in a MVP design pattern in Android with dependency injection (Dagger).
